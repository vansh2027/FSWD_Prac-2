# Lab-2 : Task Reminder System

<ins> Objective:</ins> Build a task reminder system that schedules reminders and handles asynchronous delays.

**Tasks:**

Create an array of task objects, where each task has fields like title, dueTime (in minutes from now), and priority.

**Write functions to:**

Add a new task to the list.

Sort tasks by their priority.

Display tasks due within a certain timeframe (e.g., next 10 minutes).

Simulate sending reminders using setTimeout() based on the task's dueTime.

Use try...catch to handle errors, such as invalid task data or missing fields.Export and import the task management functions using Jav aScript modules.

**Extension Ideas:**

Add a feature to delete tasks.

Implement a priority-based notification system where “High” priority tasks are reminded sooner.

Build a user interface for the system using HTML and CSS.
